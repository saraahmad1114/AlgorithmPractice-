//Question:  Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained with the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between left and right partitions.
