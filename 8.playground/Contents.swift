//Question: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the sounts of repeated characters. For example the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the compressed string would not become smaller than the orginal string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters. 

//Create a dictionary and concatenate the contents to a single string

func createACompressedString(givenString: String) -> String{





    return "happy"
}
