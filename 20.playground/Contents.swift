//Question: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit or zero edits away. 

//insert a character - meaning an extra character exists so its length = length + 1

//remove a character - meaning one character in length is missing so its length = length - 1 

//replace a string - meaning one character that so the length = length
