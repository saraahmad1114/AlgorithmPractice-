//Question: Reverse a single linked linked list. 

//defining the linked list 

//A linked list has two things a value and then a pointer or address which points to the next node in the list.

//Linked list have an advantage over an array because they are faster to use to look up things as compared to an array.

class Node {

    var value: Int
    var next: Node?
    
    init(value: Int, next: Node?) {
        self.value = value
        self.next = next
    }
}

//creating all the links in the list

let thirdNode = Node(value: 3, next: nil)

let secondNode = Node(value: 2, next: thirdNode)

let firstNode = Node(value: 1, next: secondNode)

//printing all the contents of the linked list: the list goes from 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> nil

func printLinkedList (head: Node?) -> String{

    var current = head
    
    var listVal = ""
    
    while current != nil {
        
        listVal += "\(current?.value ?? -1)"
        
        current = current?.next
    }
    
    return listVal
}

var newVal = printLinkedList(head: firstNode)


//reversing the linked list

func reverseLinkedList (head: Node?) -> Node? {

    var current = head
    var prev: Node?
    var next: Node?
    var num = 0
    
    while current != nil {
        
        next = current?.next
        
        current?.next = prev
        
        prev = current
        
        current = next
    }

    return prev
}




//next function to add the contents in the linked list
